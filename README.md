Data-Validate
=============

Easy Forms Validation: 1 Step Validation Implementation for Existing Websites. Data-Validate provides the following validations: Required Field Validators (Radio, Checkbox, TextBox), Email Validator, Password Validator, Credit Card Validator, Compare Two Fields Validator, Minimum # of Characters Validator, Maximum # of Characters Validator, Range of Characters Validator, Alpha Characters Validator, Numeric Characters Validator, Aplha-Numeric Characters Validator, Alpha-Numeric and Alpha Numeric with Spaces Validator, AND Special Characters Validator. Data-Validate is a powerful validation engine for your HTML forms. It includes both regular JavaScript and JQuery integration implementations and takes moments to integrate with your existing web site. If you already have events bound to form elements, it preserves them, but only executes them if validation passes. Fully compatible with all web based platforms. For ASP.NET MVC @Html objects, simply use the attributes parameter as follows: new { data_v_required = "", data_v_password = "" }.
