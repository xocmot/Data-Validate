Data-Validate
=============

Data-Validate is a FREE EASY TO IMPLEMENT JAVASCRIPT VALIDATION LIBRARY for any existing web application. 

Data-Validate is a powerful validation engine for your HTML forms. It includes both regular JavaScript and JQuery integration implementations and takes moments to integrate with your existing web site. If you already have events bound to form elements, it preserves them, but only executes them if validation passes. Fully compatible with all web based platforms. For ASP.NET MVC @Html objects, simply use the attributes parameter as follows: new { data_v_required = "", data_v_password = "" }.
